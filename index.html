        <h1>Introducing Myself</h1>

        <p>Hello, everyone!</p>
        <p>Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Nicole Z Liu, and I'm a software engineer at DoorDash.</p>
        <p>When it comes to my work interests, I'm particularly passionate about infrastructure. Building robust and scalable systems that power the digital world is truly fascinating to me. I enjoy diving into the complexities of distributed systems and exploring innovative solutions.</p>
        <p>Now, let me share a little bit about my hobbies. On weekends, you can often find me immersing myself in the soulful melodies of jazz. The smooth rhythms and improvisation always manage to transport me to another world. When the snowflakes start falling, you'll catch me shredding the slopes on a snowboard or skis. The thrill of gliding through the snowy terrain is simply unmatched!</p>
        <p>One of my favorite pastimes is people watching at a local café. There's something captivating about observing the bustling energy and diverse personalities that converge in a cozy café setting. It's a perfect opportunity to gain inspiration and appreciate the beauty of everyday life.</p>
        <p>Before I wrap up, I'd like to leave you with a little joke:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <em>Why don't scientists trust atoms?</em>
            <br>
            <em>Because they make up everything!</em>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Thank you for taking the time to learn a bit about me. I used ChatGPT to generate all that, and I didn't read it, so it is probably inaccurate. I read the joke tho, it was very dry, just how I make jokes, so there's that.
